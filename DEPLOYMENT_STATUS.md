# Floinvite Deployment Status Report

**Date**: November 30, 2024
**Project**: Floinvite - Visitor Management System
**Status**: 🟡 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (Awaiting DNS Configuration)

---

## Executive Summary

Your floinvite project is **fully built and ready for deployment** to Hostinger. However, there is **one critical configuration issue** that MUST be fixed before deployment can proceed:

**Your domain (floinvite.com) DNS records are incorrectly configured.**

- ❌ Currently pointing to: Cloudflare proxy IPs (104.21.32.116, 172.67.186.100)
- ✅ Should point to: Hostinger server IP (45.87.81.67)

**Fix time**: 5-15 minutes
**Complexity**: Simple - just change 2 DNS records in Cloudflare

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified

### DNS Configuration Problem

**What**: Your domain (floinvite.com) is not pointing to your Hostinger server.

**Current Setup**:
- Domain registrar: Cloudflare
- Web hosting: Hostinger (45.87.81.67)
- Issue: Cloudflare DNS records point to Cloudflare's proxy servers instead of Hostinger

**Why This Matters**:
When visitors type floinvite.com, their browser looks up the DNS records. Currently, it finds Cloudflare's IPs instead of your Hostinger server IP. This means your website won't be accessible at the domain.

**The Fix** (5 minutes):
1. Login to Cloudflare (https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Go to DNS → Records
3. Change A record for `@` to IP `45.87.81.67` with "DNS only" mode
4. Change A record for `www` to IP `45.87.81.67` with "DNS only" mode
5. Wait 5-15 minutes for propagation
6. Verify with: `nslookup floinvite.com` → should show `45.87.81.67`

**Detailed instructions** are in: `DEPLOYMENT.md` (see "CRITICAL: Domain DNS Configuration" section)

## 📋 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Fix DNS Configuration (DO THIS FIRST)
```bash
# Verify current DNS status
nslookup floinvite.com
# Currently shows: 104.21.32.116 (Cloudflare IP)
# Goal: Show 45.87.81.67 (Hostinger IP)

# Steps:
# 1. Login to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
# 2. Go to DNS → Records for floinvite.com
# 3. Edit A record "@": Change to 45.87.81.67, set to "DNS only"
# 4. Edit A record "www": Change to 45.87.81.67, set to "DNS only"
# 5. Wait 5-15 minutes
# 6. Re-run nslookup command above to verify
```

### Step 2: Complete Hostinger Domain Setup
```bash
# 1. Login to https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
# 2. Go to Websites → Manage
# 3. Add domain floinvite.com (if not listed)
# 4. Configure folder: public_html
# 5. Enable free SSL certificate
# 6. Set HTTP → HTTPS redirect
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Hostinger
Once DNS is propagated, use this command from your local machine:

```bash
# From: /home/grig/Projects/floinvite/
scp -P 65002 -r dist/* u958180753@45.87.81.67:~/public_html/
```

### Step 4: Configure SPA Routing
```bash
# SSH into Hostinger
ssh -p 65002 u958180753@45.87.81.67

# Create .htaccess for SPA routing
cat > ~/public_html/.htaccess << 'EOF'
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
EOF

# Set permissions
chmod 755 ~/public_html
chmod 644 ~/public_html/.htaccess
chmod 644 ~/public_html/*.html
```

### Step 5: Verify Live Deployment
```bash
# Open browser to: https://floinvite.com
# Check:
# - Page loads without errors
# - Favicon displays
# - All navigation works
# - localStorage persists (test by adding data, refreshing)
# - Mobile responsive (test on phone)
```

### Step 6: Security - Change SSH Password
```bash
# SSH into Hostinger
ssh -p 65002 u958180753@45.87.81.67

# Change password
passwd
# Enter current password: fl0invite55H!
# Enter new password (twice)
```

## 📞 Support Resources

**If you encounter issues:**

1. **DNS not propagating?**
   - Clear DNS cache (see PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
   - Wait another 10 minutes
   - Try from different network/device

2. **Can't access Hostinger?**
   - Verify credentials: u958180753 @ 45.87.81.67:65002
   - Check SSH is enabled in Hostinger settings
   - Try from terminal (not GUI client)

3. **Website shows blank page?**
   - Verify .htaccess exists: `cat ~/public_html/.htaccess`
   - Check Apache error logs: `tail -50 ~/logs/error.log`
   - Verify index.html uploaded: `ls ~/public_html/index.html`

4. **SSL certificate not showing?**
   - Wait 15-30 minutes after enabling
   - Force refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification

Before you start:
- ✅ Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- ✅ dist/ folder exists with all files
- ✅ SSH credentials verified working
- ✅ Hostinger account accessible
- ⏳ DNS records need updating (THIS IS THE BLOCKER)

---

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

Your project is **95% ready for deployment**. The remaining 5% is just DNS configuration (5-10 minutes of work in Cloudflare).

**Next Action**:
Update your Cloudflare DNS records to point to Hostinger (detailed instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md).

After that, you'll be able to deploy and have your website live within 30 minutes.
