# FloInvite – Pricing, Features & Positioning (Working Document)

## Purpose

This document captures the agreed direction for **FloInvite** so decisions stop looping and execution can begin. It focuses on **small companies, estates, and meeting venues** where accurate visitor records and evacuation accountability are required.

---

## Target Customer

**Who this is for**

* Small companies (SMEs)
* Estates / shared buildings
* Meeting spaces
* Property / facilities managers

**Who this is NOT for**

* Large enterprises
* Corporate HQs
* Organisations needing badges, kiosks, or QR-code workflows

> FloInvite is intentionally simple. No hardware. No enterprise theatre.

---

## Core Job-to-be-Done

> **Capture who is on site, when, and be able to prove it later.**

Secondary outcomes:

* Know who is present during an evacuation
* Reduce paperwork
* Be inspection- and audit-ready without complexity

---

## Feature Set (As Designed)

### Core Features (All Users)

* Visitor sign-in / sign-out
* Host / staff association
* Live on-site list
* Evacuation list
* Notifications (arrival / awareness)
* Offline access (on-device availability)

### Higher-Tier Features

* Secure backups
* Record retention
* Self-service exports (PDF / CSV)
* Audit convenience
* Priority support

> No badges. No QR codes. This is a deliberate choice aligned to small organisations.

---

## Data & Storage Positioning

* Base experience prioritises **on-site availability and reliability**
* Higher tier adds **convenience, retention, and peace of mind**

**Important framing rule:**

* Base tier must feel **defensible**, not provisional
* Upgrade is about *not having to think about it*, not fixing a risk

Suggested wording:

> "Evidence access available when required." (Standard tier)

---

## Pricing Structure (Two Tiers)

### Starter Allowance

* Free up to **20 active records** (combined visitors + hosts)
* Designed for evaluation and light usage
* Framed as a *starter allowance*, not a trial or trap
* Clear tracking: "20 active" = 20 people across both categories (e.g., 15 visitors + 5 hosts = 20 total)

---

### Tier 1: Standard (Recommended)

**$29–$39 per site / month** *(initial test at $29 if risk-averse)*

Includes:

* Visitor sign-in / sign-out
* Live on-site & evacuation lists
* Notifications (arrival, awareness)
* Offline access (on-device availability)
* Access current and recent visit records in-app
* Email support

Positioning:

> "Everything a small organisation needs to know who is on site."

**Standard record access:**
* View current and recent visitor records in-app
* Suitable for day-to-day operations and short-term lookups
* No long-term retention, exports, or automatic backups

---

### Tier 2: Compliance+

**$49–$59 per site / month**

Includes:

* Everything in Standard
* Secure backups
* Long-term record retention
* Self-service exports (PDF / CSV)
* Audit-ready wording
* Priority support

Positioning:

> "For estates and organisations that must retain records and stay audit-ready."

**What you gain vs. Standard:**
* Secure backups and long-term retention
* Self-service PDF/CSV exports
* Audit-ready language and priority support

---

### Enterprise

Setup and onboarding are handled case-by-case under Enterprise.

---

## Pricing & Brand Principles

### What We DO

* Price for **credibility**, not cheapness
* Sell **outcomes**, not tech
* Use higher tier as peace-of-mind anchor
* Keep choices simple (2 tiers only)

### What We DO NOT Do

* No "cup of coffee" messaging
* No sub-$20 paid plans
* No technical architecture explanations in marketing
* No feature bloat to chase enterprises

---

## Usage Enforcement Rules

* Enforcement occurs at **20 active records** (combined visitors + hosts)
* Soft warnings at 80% usage
* Read-only access at limit (no data loss)
* Clear, calm upgrade messaging

Correct framing:

> "Starter includes up to 20 active records (visitors + hosts combined) — upgrade to Standard when your team or visitor flow grows."

**Example scenarios:**
* 10 hosts + 10 visitors = 20 active (at limit)
* 5 hosts + 15 visitors = 20 active (at limit)
* Archived guests don't count toward the 20 limit

---

## One-Line Positioning Statement

> **Simple visitor records and evacuation lists for small organisations — without enterprise complexity.**

---

## Final Decision Summary

* Feature set is correct for the target market
* Pricing must signal seriousness and trust
* Affordability is a benefit, not the headline
* Execution now matters more than debate

**Next focus:** selling, outreach, and first paying customers.
